## Game Logic

```
XXX Remember to delete the instructions for this repo section below before finalizing and submitting your project because this project is part of your portfolio you should be showcasing. XXX

Instructions: 
The writing should describe in plain, simple language the logic of the game.
Describe the logic involved in player decisions.
  - What are the choices available to the player?
  - What happens when the player makes a choice?
Describe the logic that evaluates the player's victory/loss/progress status:

So The Memory Game is a single player game. In this game there is 16 cards every card has own match.
If the card does not match then you can see the message "please try again" and if all cards match, then you can
see the message "you Won".
